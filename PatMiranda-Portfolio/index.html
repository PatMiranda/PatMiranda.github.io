                Patrick Miranda is a Denver based voice over artist, chef, and student at the DU Coding Boot-Camp. As a Denver Native, he began theatrical acting training at the age of 8, with the Denver Center Theater Academy, and went on to attend Denver School of the Arts as a theater major for 7 years. 

After 12 years of theatrical acting training, as well as some professional work on Denver stages such as Curious Theater Company, Denver Repertory Theater, and Avenue Theater, he decided to diversify.

Getting the idea from a line from his favorite play at the time, Kenneth Lonnergan's "This is Our Youth," Patrick decided to study the culinary arts abroad at Alma, a prestigious cooking school outside of Parma, Italy. After the program was finished, and he had a taste for the Michelin Star life style, he returned to the stage and began studying at the Stella Adler Acting Conservatory in NYC. 

In the years since then, he has worn many hats, vocal coach, acting teacher, <a href="https://www.patmiranda.com" target="_blank">voice actor</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrm/" target="_blank">sous-chef</a>, and father. 

Patrick lives in Denver with his daughter Lilliana.
